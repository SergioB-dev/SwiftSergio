### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sergio, a passionate iOS Developer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Arabic Grammar](https://github.com/SwiftSergio/ArabicGrammar) an app with the purpose of facilitating Arabic for anyone looking to learn the language. I love leveraging technology to satisfy a need. As someone who has learned arabic, my aim in this app is to really highlight the fundamentals of the language and progress from there.
